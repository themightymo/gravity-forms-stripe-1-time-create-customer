# Gravity Forms Stripe 1-time Purchase Create Customer

## THE PROBLEM:
Gravity Forms has a Stripe add-on that connects to Stripe and allows for 1-time and recurring purchases. The is add-on does not create Stripe Customers for for 1-time purchases (By comparison, it DOES create Stripe Customers for recurring purchases).  

## The Fix
1. Activate this plugin.
2. Create a 1-time purchase Gravity Form.
3. Create a Gravity Forms Stripe feed with the name, "1-time".
4. On the form, set the "Receipt" field to be email (screengrab below).

That's it!
